> Percussion Group Website. With an accessible access page with a Gallery, Calendar, About us, Localization and Contacta sections. In addition, there is a Back-End only (supposed to) accessed by Users of the Group, where they can add and update their info.

## Motivation

This was a project that I had to present in my high school (final year project), where I needed to develop a tool to improve or fix an actual situation. So, I chose to take this percussion group, which had no website or means to keep all the information of their elements.
